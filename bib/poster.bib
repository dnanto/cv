  abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria express a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that stabilizes the outer membrane while promoting host-pathogen interactions. A conserved gene cluster encodes the O-antigen (O-PS), which forms the external component of this endotoxin and is the basis of serological subspecies classification. Our previous research developed a general pipeline to extract regions flanked by conserved sequences. We improved and extended the algorithm to extract the O-PS from Vibrio cholerae with the intention of analyzing the molecular clock signal. This region is highly polymorphic and a hotspot for lateral gene transfer. Our process therefore clusters the extracted regions for separate analysis, avoiding undesirable artifacts and the need for ancestral recombination graphs. The pipeline described below extracts regions and metadata from NCBI GenBank for automated molecular clock analysis.

  abstract = {Background: The role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the diversification of bacterial populations is well established. HGT events may result in acquisition of adaptive features such as virulence factors. The O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters in Vibrio cholerae are exemplary of this mechanism. The wb* gene clusters involved in O-antigen biosynthesis are specifically located on Chromosome I in the more than 200 distinct serogroups. The precise mechanisms and the pool of genetic variants of the biosynthesis genes are not completely elucidated. The availability of whole genome sequence data facilitates the quantification of O-antigen genetic diversity and understanding of the underlying evolutionary forces. Materials: The bioinformatics pipeline includes a workflow of scripts and tools to automatically download sequences, identify conserved regions, and establish phylogenies. Results: We have created a bioinformatics pipeline to extract the O-antigen biosynthesis regions from various V. cholerae draft genome sequences. The pipeline extracted the wb* regions from the whole genome sequences of O1, O139, and non-O1/O139 other strains. A detailed description of the pipeline is presented in this report. Annotation of the various wb* clusters and phylogenies based on wb* region junction genes and some conserved genes within the wb* clusters are compared to the phylogeny of the core genomes of the various strains. Conclusions: The results of the phylogenetic analyses indicate extensive gene transfer between serogroups similar to that found in other virulence regions. There are only very few known instances of en bloc HGT transfer of wb* clusters within the strains for which WGS are available. Analogous to serogroups O37 and O139 that have acquired different wb* clusters in an epidemic background, an instance of O1 antigen cluster (wbe) transfer to non-epidemic strain backgrounds have been found in this study. This study calls for WGS sequencing of the entire Sakazaki serogroup collection in order to assess genetic diversity and the reasons for the high epidemic potential of the O1 strain and its derivatives. The pipeline created here can be used as a general tool for extraction of specific genomic regions from draft genome sequences.},

  abstract = {The democapsid application is an interactive, browser-based tool for designing accurate three-dimensional models of icosahedral viral capsids and exporting them to SVG, which is an infinitely scalable format compatible with widely available office-productivity software. This allows the user to easily edit the model without losing quality. Thus, the goal is to aid in the design of publication-quality diagrams to communicate results in molecular biology and nanotechnology. Initially, the code implemented Caspar-Klug Theory (1), which defines a method for the construction of icosahedral capsids. It is based on a parameterized walk over a hexagonal unit lattice, which starts by moving h units forward, turning 60 degrees (levo or dextro), and moving k units forward until a triangular face is carved. An additional step arranges the face into an icosahedron. Moody extended this model to account for bacilliform phages with fivefold symmetry (2). Here, an updated version of democapsid is presented based on results from Luque and Reguera, whose work generalized the models of Caspar, Klug, and Moody for elongated capsids with fivefold, threefold, and twofold symmetry (3). Additional methods were developed to realize the corresponding three-dimensional structures and described here. The implementation is also consistent with the work of Twarock and Luque, which provides additional Archimedean lattices models (4).

  abstract = {The Mastadenovirus genus includes species that infect mammalian hosts. There are seven different species of Human adenovirus (HAdV), A through G, comprising 104 genotypes to date. Each genotype has unique properties with different tissue tropism or transmission route, causing illness including acute respiratory disease, keratoconjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis. Epidemiology also correlates with genotype as some are more contagious, thrive in dense living conditions (such as barracks and universities), and cause outbreaks around the world with fatal outcomes or severe febrile illness. Thus, proper characterization of sample genomes is critical for understanding the evolution of these circulating and emerging pathogens. Typing via serum neutralization (SN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) are obsolete in the genomics era, especially since they only cover a small, imputed fraction of the genome. Additionally, recombination is a major evolutionary force and has been observed giving rise to new genotypes. As the virus evolves, so do the need and criteria for typing. This project investigates the potential for an updated informatics-based approach with the Nextclade tool of the Nextstrain suite, which is currently used for assigning SARS-CoV-2 samples to clades built with a curated set of reference sequences. This work also provides a dataset for testing Nextclade against DNA viruses since it is currently aimed at RNA genomes.},

  abstract = {Populations are increasingly at risk of exposure to emerging infectious diseases due to globalization, habitat encroachment, climate change, conflict, and inconsistent public health policy. Detection is therefore critical for monitoring outbreaks and spillover in high-risk environments to prevent subsequent transmission across borders. Accordingly, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has motivated the design and deployment of numerous PCR and LAMP assays. However, pathogen evolution threatens the efficacy of assays as accumulated mutations help escape primer binding, resulting in false negatives. A continuous, biosurveillance-informed process can mitigate the emergence of blind spots by monitoring assay effectiveness and generating novel assays to replace failing or obsolete kits. To this end, we developed the BioLaboro pipeline to rapidly prototype PCR assays and monitor signature erosion over time. It is a modular system that uses data from GenBank to compute signature sequences (BioVelocity), primer generation (Primer3), and alignment-based validation (PSET) against millions of sequences. In this study, we extended the pipeline to include LAMP assay generation and validation. As an example, we determined whether plausible PCR assays exist for species and strain-level discrimination of African swine fever virus (ASFV) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Our goal is to compare these assays to existing ones and distribute them to help inform vaccine development and detect outbreaks at borders or, ideally, at the source.},

This follow-up study compares the wb* region against the genomic backbone using phylogenic methods.
